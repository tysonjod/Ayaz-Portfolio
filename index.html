                    <h2>Problem Solving Skill</h2>
                    <p>I definitely have a problem solving skills by this skill I can solve any kind of problem. I can
                        easily understand the problem of the client and provide him a good solution.this skill has
                        helped me a lot in my school,college and in real life situations.This skill is very important
                        and everybody should have it.</p>

                    <h2>Creativity Skill </h2>
                    <p>This is again very important skill.I have helped many of my colleagues to think out of the box
                        idea and artistic creativity. One of the most typical yet in-demand creative skills. If you are
                        able to write in a compelling, creative way, it will help you a great deal in marketing, sales
                        and, obviously, journalism. But it will also come in handy in all other positions that require
                        writing—even if you’re just drafting emails, reports, and presentations.</p>

                <h2>Tindog Website</h2>
                <p> The First Social app for dog lovers who want to connect with other owners nearby that share a
                    similar passion for canines. Whether it's to build new friendships or make a love connection.

                <h2>Mondrian Art</h2>
                <p> Mondrian Project made with only html and css. It was very confussing and took lot of time and
                    effortd but in the end I somehow managed to complete this wonderfull art. Composition with Red,
                    Blue, and Yellow can be a baffling experience (see image above).</p>
